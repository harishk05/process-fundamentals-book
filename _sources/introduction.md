# Process Fundamentals

An organizationâ€™s success depends on how efficiently and effectively it _executes_ its strategic goals. This requires a detailed understanding of the *processes* that are used to produce and deliver goods and services to customers. A process refers to how work flows through an organization, how resources should be organized to achieve desired outcomes, and the challenges that arise in managing process. An important consideration is that processes and people need to work together in order for organizations to achieve their purpose. Topics covered in this book include process analysis, capacity analysis, process design, theory of constraints, and lean operations.

The material presented in this book is meant to augment case discussions in class.
