<h1>Introduction to Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>What is a process? And why study them?</p>
<p>To understand this, let us start with the following exercise.</p>
<p>Think of an organization that you think is “well run”.  Describe why you think that this organization is well run.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Describe a restaurant (or airline/airport/hospital/factory) that is well run.</p>
</div>
<!--Typically, this discussion will highlight factors that students (as customers) associate with good operations. These factors will include things like quality of the product (fewer defects or errors), quality of the service (less wait or faster service), the overall experience, cost, etc.-->
<p>A well run organization clearly provides customers with things that they value. But it does more that that. It is not just outputs that we should care about, it is also inputs. In other words, it is not just the outputs that matter, it is also the inputs.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="input-output">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/input-output.png"><img alt="_images/input-output.png" src="_images/input-output.png" style="height: 150px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 1 </span><span class="caption-text">Input and output</span><a class="headerlink" href="#input-output" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>In other words, to achieve a well run organization, or an organization with good operations, we need to get the right outputs with the fewest inputs. This is easier said than done, and this course will explore how we can achieve this.</p>
<p>Before we go further, it will be useful to explore the concept of “efficiency.” Efficiency is defined in many different ways. In economics, efficiency usually refers to the allocation of the economy’s limited resources to produce outputs that maximize benefits to society. A simple way to understand this is to consider an economy that produces only two items: guns (representing products that are used for war) and butter (representing products that are used to provide food to the population).</p>
<p>An efficient economy is one that uses its resources to find the “right” balance between guns and butter (i.e. finds the balance that maximizes value for society). For example, a society that produces no guns may be under threat from enemies, but a society that produces only guns will also be at risk (of starvation).</p>
<p>This kind of efficiency is referred to as “allocative efficiency” and the right balance between guns and butter depends on what the society values. The right balance may change over time. For example, if there is a war, then society may place a higher value on guns. In times of peace, it will value butter more. The red line represents what is called an production possibility frontier, which represents the trade-off between the alternatives. If you want more guns, you have to give up some butter, and vice versa. Of course, this is a highly simplified version of the trade-off that real economies face – but this is meant to simply highlight the basic idea.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="allocative-efficiency-economy">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/allocative-efficiency.png"><img alt="_images/allocative-efficiency.png" src="_images/allocative-efficiency.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 2 </span><span class="caption-text">Allocative efficiency in the economy</span><a class="headerlink" href="#allocative-efficiency-economy" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>The notion of allocative efficiency is important in management as well. For example, firms make strategic choices all the time. A fast food restaurant focuses its resources on maximizing output (or “throughput”). A high-end restaurant will likely focus on quality. A firm that is competing in the fast food industry has to prioritize the maximization of output, and it will allocate resources and make decisions to support that goal. A high-end restaurant will make different choices about how to allocate its resources. These kinds of strategic decisions are similar to the notion of allocative efficiency discussed above in that organizations have to make strategic choices: their are inherent trade-offs like the guns versus butter trade-off discussed above. Just like the economy faces trade-offs, so does an organization.  Like the production possibility frontier of the economy, we can think of an organization also facing a production frontier which represents the trade-offs that a firm has to confront.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 3 </span><span class="caption-text">Allocative efficiency within an organization</span><a class="headerlink" href="#allocative-efficiency-organization" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>In this course, we are interested in operational efficiency. How does operational efficiency in an organization differ from allocative efficiency? Consider the figure above, but assume that a firm is not on  the production possibility frontier. Rather, assume that the firm is somewhere “below” this frontier.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="operational-efficiency-organization">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/operational-efficiency.png"><img alt="_images/operational-efficiency.png" src="_images/operational-efficiency.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 4 </span><span class="caption-text">Operational efficiency within an organization</span><a class="headerlink" href="#operational-efficiency-organization" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>Why would a firm be below the frontier? Simply moving to frontier would improve both throughput and quality. Staying below the frontier, therefore, seems like a form of waste, i.e. firms are not using their resources to get the most output.</p>
<p>Would a firm choose to be below the frontier? It appears not. But, for a variety of reasons, all organizations operate below the frontier.</p>
<p>To understand why this is so, it is important to note that (unlike in the simple illustrations above) the frontier is not clearly demarcated. First, the frontier moves as technology and knowledge advance. The production possibilities in the year 1921 would have been much below the production possibilities of the year 2021. Similarly, the production possibilities of the year 2121 will (hopefully!) be higher than the 2021 production possibility.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>It is possible that, as a society, we run into other constraints (e.g. those imposed by a warming planet). But that is a hurdle that we can hopefully overcome as our knowledge and institutions adapt.</p>
</div>
<p>Furthermore, the production possibility frontier for a particular organization could be well below what is technologically feasible. This could be for a variety of reasons. For example, some firms may be inefficient but survive because they are in an industry that is not very competitive. Some firms may survive because of political patronage. Family-run firms are cited as an example of firms that do not bring in outside experts and knowledge because they want to maintain control of the firm.</p>
<p>In practice, all firms are below the frontier (for one reason or another). The better managed firms are closer to the frontier. The worse, are further away. A classic example, is from the automotive industry. In the second half of the twentieth century, the American car manufacturers dominated the world. But the Japanese auto industry, led by Toyota, pioneered new management practices (now called “lean”) that led to much better outcomes that the established companies.</p>
