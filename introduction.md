# Process Fundamentals

An organizationâ€™s success depends on how efficiently and effectively it _executes_ its strategic goals. This requires a detailed understanding of the *processes* that are used to produce and deliver goods and services to customers. A process refers to how work flows (and should flow) through an organization, and how resources should be organized and allocated to achieve desired outcomes. An important consideration is that processes and people need to work together in order for organizations to achieve their purpose. Topics covered in this book include process analysis, capacity analysis, process design, theory of constraints, and lean operations, and the challenges that arise in managing process. 

The material presented in this book is meant to augment the presentation and case discussions that take place in class.
